# CCPP (Concern/Code Provenance Policy)

## Purpose
Define lightweight provenance and comment rules for Calculogic repositories.

## Rules
1. Keep comments focused on intent, constraints, and invariants.
2. Avoid stale implementation comments; prefer self-descriptive names and tests.
3. When behavior is governed by architecture/docs, reference the source doc in nearby comments or commit/PR notes.
4. Preserve public behavior unless a task explicitly changes it.
5. Keep changes minimal and scoped to the concern being modified.
