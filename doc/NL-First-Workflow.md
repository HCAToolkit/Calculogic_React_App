# NL-First Workflow

## Workflow
1. Capture/update a concise NL skeleton for the change before editing code.
2. Keep NL step ordering aligned with implementation commits.
3. Preserve constraints/invariants in NL and verify in tests/build.
4. Update architecture docs when structural boundaries change.
